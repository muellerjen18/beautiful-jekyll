Hi, I’m Jennifer 👋  
I’m a Data Science II student at ASU who likes turning messy data into clean stories — and I also coach varsity volleyball 🏐.

### What I’m into right now
- 📊 Building projects in R (and learning how to publish them like a real adult)
- 🧠 Making dashboards + visuals that actually make sense
- ☕ Starbucks life (I take coffee seriously)
- 🏐 Coaching + strategy + teamwork

### My “stats” (unofficial)
- Favorite dataset: the one that *doesn’t* fight me
- Debug style: print statements + deep breaths
- Current vibe: “a little data, a little chaos, a lot of learning”

### What you’ll find on this site
- My labs + class work for Data Science II
- Mini writeups about what I learned (and what broke)
- A growing portfolio as I level up my analytics skills
