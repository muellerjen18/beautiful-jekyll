I’ve always been interested in how decisions get made — especially the ones that affect people.

That’s what led me to pursue a Master’s in Program Evaluation & Data Analytics. I wanted to move beyond opinions and into evidence. Beyond “what feels right” and into “what works.”

Right now I’m building skills in:

- R and statistical modeling  
- Program evaluation design  
- Data visualization (Tableau & Power BI)  
- Reproducible research  

My goal is simple: use data to create clarity.

This site is part experiment, part portfolio, and part growth log as I keep learning.
